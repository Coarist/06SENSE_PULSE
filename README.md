# 06SENSE_PULSE
This project produces firmware for 06SENSE. Function is to sense (speed) pulse time interval. When this time interval is smaller than a predetermined limit (meaning higher frequency hence speed), an alert or an alarm will be produced.  

# CRTOS
Multi-tasking kernel for small Microchip MCUs `PIC10` `PIC12` `PIC16` `PIC18`

Time-slicing cooperative multitasking `C` language source code for system engineering and lowest footprint. 
The CRTOS scheme ensure real-time performance. The code files are built using: 
```
Microchip MPLAB X IDE v5.25
Microchip XC8 v1.42 compiler
```
